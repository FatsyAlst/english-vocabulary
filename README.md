# 📚 English Vocabulary Tracker

**Learn English vocabulary through the media you love.**

A personal project by a Brazilian English learner who believes that media—anime, movies, series—is one of the richest resources for language acquisition. This isn't just a vocabulary list; it's a system for **tracking**, **studying**, and **truly fixing** new words in your memory.

## 🎯 The Philosophy

Traditional vocabulary learning can feel disconnected from real language. But when you learn words from content you genuinely enjoy, something changes:

- **Context becomes memorable** — You remember *where* you heard a word
- **Emotional connection** — The scenes, characters, and moments stick with you
- **Natural usage** — You see how words are actually used, not just dictionary definitions

This project takes that idea and adds structure: **track every word, understand it deeply, and practice until it sticks.**

## 📖 What's Inside

### 🔤 Vocabulary Browser
Currently tracking **72+ words** from Dragon Ball Z (English dub), each with:
- Oxford-style definitions with part of speech and pronunciation
- Multiple example sentences showing real usage
- Portuguese translations (toggle on/off)
- Word families, collocations, etymology, and usage notes
- Audio pronunciation (US/UK voices)

### 📝 Practice Exercises
Downloadable PDF exercise sets organized by difficulty:

| Difficulty | Focus |
|------------|-------|
| **Easy** | Recognition, matching, basic recall |
| **Medium** | Context application, collocations, comprehension |
| **Hard** | Production, analysis, creative usage |

Each set includes **spaced repetition** — review words from previous sets to reinforce long-term retention.

### 📰 Blog
Supplementary reading documenting interesting linguistic discoveries and cultural notes encountered along the way.

## 🎓 Who Is This For?

- **Non-native English speakers** at intermediate level or above
- People who want to go from "I understand English" to "I sound natural and spontaneous"
- Anyone who believes learning should be enjoyable, not just effective

> **Note:** Basic English comprehension is recommended. This project assumes you can already follow English content and want to expand and refine your vocabulary.

## 💡 Why I Made This

I created this because I realized I was passively consuming English content without truly *learning* from it. Words would come and go. I'd understand them in context but couldn't recall or use them later.

So I asked myself: **What if I did this properly?**

- Track every interesting word I encounter
- Study it with real definitions and examples
- Create exercises to practice actively
- Review regularly so it actually sticks

The result? I've been learning way more vocabulary and genuinely retaining it. After consistent practice, my English started sounding more natural and spontaneous—not just "correct."

## 🚀 Build Your Own

**This is a personal project, and I encourage you to create something similar for yourself.**

The real value isn't in using *my* word list—it's in building *your own* system around content *you* love. Whether it's anime, podcasts, movies, or books, the process of tracking and exercising vocabulary is what makes the difference.
